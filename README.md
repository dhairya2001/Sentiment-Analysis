# ‚úàÔ∏è Twitter Sentiment Analysis with LSTM

## üìå Description

This project is a **Twitter Sentiment Analysis system** built using **TensorFlow** and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks. The goal is to classify tweets as either **positive** or **negative**, based on their textual content.

We use the **Kaggle Airline Tweets Dataset**, which contains over 14,000 labeled tweets related to major U.S. airlines. The tweets are preprocessed (removing URLs, mentions, stopwords, etc.), tokenized, and padded before being passed into an LSTM model.

The model achieves around **85% test accuracy** and can predict the sentiment of any tweet input. It can be extended for neutral class classification or real-time analysis using Twitter's API.
